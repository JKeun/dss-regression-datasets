In this competition, Kaggle is challenging you to build a model that predicts the total ride duration of taxi trips in New York City. Your primary dataset is one released by the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission, which includes pickup time, geo-coordinates, number of passengers, and several other variables.

Longtime Kagglers will recognize that this competition objective is similar to the ECML/PKDD trip time challenge we hosted in 2015. But, this challenge comes with a twist. Instead of awarding prizes to the top finishers on the leaderboard, this playground competition was created to reward collaboration and collective learning.

We are encouraging you (with cash prizes!) to publish additional training data that other participants can use for their predictions. We also have designated bi-weekly and final prizes to reward authors of kernels that are particularly insightful or valuable to the community.

### Data Description
The competition dataset is based on the [2016 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-tlc-trips) made available in Big Query on Google Cloud Platform. The data was originally published by the [NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml). The data was sampled and cleaned for the purposes of this playground competition. Based on individual trip attributes, participants should predict the duration of each trip in the test set.

### File descriptions

- train.csv - the training set (contains 1458644 trip records)
- test.csv - the testing set (contains 625134 trip records)
- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format

### Data fields

- id - a unique identifier for each trip
- vendor_id - a code indicating the provider associated with the trip record
- pickup_datetime - date and time when the meter was engaged
- dropoff_datetime - date and time when the meter was disengaged
- passenger_count - the number of passengers in the vehicle (driver entered value)
- pickup_longitude - the longitude where the meter was engaged
- pickup_latitude - the latitude where the meter was engaged
- dropoff_longitude - the longitude where the meter was disengaged
- dropoff_latitude - the latitude where the meter was disengaged
- store_and_fwd_flag - This flag indicates whether the trip record was held in vehicle memory before sending to the vendor because the vehicle did not have a connection to the server - Y=store and forward; N=not a store and forward trip
- trip_duration - duration of the trip in seconds

Disclaimer: The decision was made to not remove dropoff coordinates from the dataset order to provide an expanded set of variables to use in Kernels.
